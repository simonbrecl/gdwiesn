### Description:
The player is the owner of a “Studentenfestzelt”, an Oktoberfest tent dedicated to students by providing cheap beer. However, student prices aren't exactly giving him all the returns he need to break even. He has to complete all 16 days of Oktoberfest by meeting the loan payments required each day. To do this, the player must prepare and deliver as much beer and food as possible while managing and upgrading the facilities, staff and stock.
